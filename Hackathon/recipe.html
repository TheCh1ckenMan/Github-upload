    <H1>Spanikopita Recipe(Greek Spinach Pie)</H1>

    <h2>If you have not tried Spanakopita before, you're in for a treat!
    </h2>
    <br>
    
    <p id="first">Spanakopita makes a great side dish for large holiday dinners next to lamb or lemon chicken. But it can easily stand alone as the main dish. Serve it with a big salad like Greek salad; Balela; or this Mediterranean chickpea salad, and favorite dips like Greek Tzatziki or Roasted Garlic Hummus.

    <h3>1. The Spanakopita Filling</h3>
    
    <p>The key filling ingredients in a classic spanakopita recipe are spinach and feta cheese. And yes, only use quality feta cheese, no other cheese qualifies for spanakopita.
         To the spinach and feta, we add flavor makers in the form of fresh herbs and aromatics. I used two whole bunches of parsley (parsley stems pack a ton of flavor, by the way, so don't be afraid to throw some in) Then, onions, garlic and a little dry dill weed.
        To bind everything together, I used four large eggs.

    <h3>2. Do I need to cook the Spinach in Advance?</h3>
    
    <p>You need a good amount of spinach in this recipe, so using frozen spinach is the way to go. In this easy spanakopita recipe, frozen spinach--fully thawed, of course--is mixed right in with the remaining filling ingredients, no advanced cooking necessary.
        But one thing you must do, be sure to drain all liquid from the thawed spinach. I ended up squeezing the spinach by hand a few times until it could no longer produce any liquid. If you do use fresh spinach, you will need to cook it with the onions and garlic, drain, and let cool completely before mixing the filling.

    <h3>3. The Phyllo
    </h3>

    <p>Golden, crispy phyllo pastry, encasing the soft spinach filling is really what spanakopita is all about! Quality of phyllo (fillo) dough can make or break the recipe! I am a big fan of organic dough from The Fillo Factory. It's vegan and contains no preservatives; no cholesterol; and no trans fat. And be sure follow the tips below for best results.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Tips for working with Phyllo Dough:</strong></p>

    <p>- Thaw phyllo dough properly; too much moisture will make the dough or sheets sticky and hard to manage.  When thawing, do not remove the phyllo (fillo) from the package, place it in the fridge 12-14 hours before using.
    </p>

    <br>
    
    <p>-Do not skimp on the oil, but don't overdo it either. Some use butter, but I use quality extra virgin olive oil here instead to keep it light. You need to brush each of the phyllo layers with a little olive oil 
    </p>

    <p>-Remember, Phyllo (fillo) sheets will tear, and that's perfectly fine. Just make sure you save a couple good sheets for the top of your spanakopita casserole.
    </p>

    <p>Once spanakopita filling is spread well in the center, lay the remainder of the phyllo dough sheets on top (you will follow the same process, working one sheet at a time and brushing each layer with extra virgin olive oil.)

    <ul>
        <li>16 oz frozen chopped spinach, thawed and well-drained</li>

            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li> tbsp Private Reserve extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>10.5 oz quality feta cheese, crumbled</li>
            <li>2 tsp dried dill weed</li>
            <li>Freshly-ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
<h4>For the Crust</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>1 16 oz package The Fillo Factory Organic Dough (#4 pastry sheets), properly thawed (see tips above)</li>
        <li>1 cup Private Reserve extra virgin olive oil, more if needed
        </li>
    </ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.</li>
        <li> Before you begin mixing the filling, be sure the spinach is very well drained, and squeeze out any excess liquid by hand.</li>
        <li>To make the filling: In a mixing bowl, add the spinach and the remaining filling ingredients. Stir until all is well-combined.</li>
        <li>Unroll the phyllo (fillo) sheets and place them between two slightly damp kitchen cloths.</li>
        <li>Prepare a 9 Â½" X 13" baking dish like this one. Brush the bottom and sides of the dish with olive oil.</li>
        <li>To assemble the spanakopita: Line the baking dish with two sheets of phyllo (fillo) letting them cover the sides of the dish. Brush with olive oil. Add two more sheets in the same manner, and brush them with olive oil. Repeat until two-thirds of the phyllo (fillo) is used up.</li>
        <li>Now, evenly spread the spinach and feta filling over the phyllo (fillo) crust. Top with two more sheets, and brush with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Continue to layer the phyllo (fillo) sheets, two-at-a-time, brushing with olive oil, until you have used up all the sheets. Brush the very top layer with olive oil, and sprinkle with just a few drops of water.</li>
        <li>Fold the flaps or excess from the sides, you can crumble them a little. Brush the folded sides well with olive oil. Cut Spanakopita ONLY PART-WAY through into squares, or leave the cutting to later.</li>
        <li>Bake in the 325 degrees F heated-oven for 1 hour, or until the phyllo (fillo) crust is crisp and golden brown. Remove from the oven. Finish cutting into squares and serve. Enjoy!</li>
